# Linear Search

## What is Jump Search? 
Linear search is an algorithm to search for the target in an array (the array may or may not be sorted).
We iterate through each of the elements in the given array and compare it to the target until we find the target or reach the end of the array.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of linear search is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the given array.
